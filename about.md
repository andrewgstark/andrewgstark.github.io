My name is Andrew and I'm a data analyst in the SF Bay Area. The purpose of my blog is to help the public understand more about their communities, through the analysis of open datasets.  

As more governments embrace open data initiatives, there's a need for data professionals to extract intelligence from the raw numbers. My goal is to make data accessible, and encourage a more informed and engaged society.

If you have any comments, or suggestions for future projects, welcome to contact me.
